### Description

Zingaro is a customizable electronics storefront built with Vue and Medusa. 

### Preview

In this section, include any type of preview elements that would give an insight into what your submission looks like. It can be GIFs, images, videos, or anything similar.

Some examples of previews based on repository type:

- For storefront submissions, GIFs are highly recommended that showcase the entire flow (products list, add to cart, checkout, etc…)
- For integration submissions, images that showcase the integration between Medusa and the tool or service used are recommended.

## Set up Project

This section should cover how to set up and run the project locally. It’s intended to help the Medusa team properly review your submission, as well as help the community to benefit from your submission.

### Prerequisites

If running your submission requires any prerequisites, make sure to list them in this section.

Examples of Prerequisites:

- Medusa Server (Link to [Quickstart](https://docs.medusajs.com/quickstart/quick-start) here).
- Create an account in service X (for integrations with other services).
- Redis, PostgreSQL, or any of Medusa’s configurations or plugins.

### Install Project

In this section, cover step by step how to run your submission, with each step having a code block example of the command if applicable.

For example:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone XXX
```

1. Change directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd directory
npm install
```
